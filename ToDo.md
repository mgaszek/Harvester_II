Integrate ML for signals (e.g., scikit-learn).

Approach: Add optional ML-based G-Score in signals.py.

Critical: Mitigate Backtesting Pitfalls and Biases (8-12 hours)

Address overfitting, look-ahead, survivorship biases.

Approach: In backtest.py, implement walk-forward optimization (, ); use survivor-free data (e.g., via ccxt); add out-of-sample tests.


Enhance realism with slippage, commissions, liquidity.

Approach: Model volume-based impact in _execute_entry_backtest (, ).



High: Integrate Mature Backtesting Library (12-18 hours)

Replace custom BacktestEngine with vectorbt or Backtesting.py.

Approach: Refactor backtest.py to use vectorbt for vectorized speed (, ); keep custom signals as plugins.



High: Expand and Automate Testing (10-15 hours)

Achieve 90% coverage with pytest-cov; add bias assertions.

Approach: In test_backtest.py, simulate biases and assert prevention; integrate CI (pre-commit with Ruff).


Add integration tests for trailing stops and async.

Approach: Mock positions in test_risk_manager.py; test concurrency in test_integration.py.



High: Optimize Data Processing Fully (6-8 hours)

Mandate Polars for all Pandas ops.

Approach: Migrate utils.py/signals.py fully; benchmark vs. Pandas.



Medium: Eliminate Remaining Duplication and Refine Logic (4-6 hours)

Centralize all calcs in utils.py.

Approach: Remove dupes from signals.py/risk_manager.py.
